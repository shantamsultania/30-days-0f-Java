# MVC - Model View Controller 

This is a design pattern approach that is used with applications that have a UI approach 

In short, The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components is built to handle specific development aspects of an application.

1. Model - Model represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to update the controller if its data changes.
2. View - View represents the visualization of the data that the model contains.
3. Controller - Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into a model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.


# Use Case 
It is a design pattern that is used to separate the business logic, presentation logic, and data. The controller acts as an interface between View and Model. Controller intercepts all the incoming requests.
